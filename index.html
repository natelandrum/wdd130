            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Nathan Landrum. I'm from Georgia in the USA, but currently reside in Mexico with my beautiful
                wife and twin boys. Some things I like to do are hike, go bowling, spend time with my family, and program.<br><br>
                My interest in programming began in my mid-twenties when I discovered the power of coding to solve complex problems. 
                Over the last few years, I have expanded my knowledge through courses on UDEMY in Python and Web Development.<br><br>
                My goal is to become a full-stack developer, work for a fortune 500 company, and in 10 years open my own business offering 
                all around software, hardware, and cybersecurity solutions.
            </p>

            <p>Mexico is a country rich in History, tradition, and culture. From its regional dances to its delicious food, Mexico is full of
                surpises. In 2022 alone there were more than 38 million tourists and 66 million international visitors. With a population of over 100 million, Mexico is the country with more
                Spanish speakers than any other in the world.
